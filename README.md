# Decentralized Public Park Maintenance System

A blockchain-powered platform that revolutionizes public park management through transparent asset tracking, automated maintenance scheduling, community engagement, and efficient resource allocation.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent, efficient, and participatory approach to public park maintenance. By decentralizing key management functions, we enable better stewardship of public spaces, improve operational efficiency, increase community involvement, and ensure equitable resource distribution across park systems.

## Smart Contracts

### 1. Asset Registration Contract

Maintains a comprehensive registry of all park assets and infrastructure:

- Detailed inventory of facilities, equipment, and natural features
- Digital twin creation with unique identifiers for each asset
- Geospatial mapping and location tracking
- Condition assessment and quality ratings
- Asset lifecycle tracking with installation and maintenance history
- Ownership and responsibility assignment
- Depreciation and replacement scheduling

### 2. Maintenance Scheduling Contract

Automates and optimizes regular upkeep activities:

- Preventive maintenance scheduling based on manufacturer specifications
- Seasonal maintenance cycles for weather-dependent tasks
- Maintenance procedure documentation and verification
- Work order generation and assignment
- Completion verification and quality assurance
- Maintenance history recording for each asset
- Schedule optimization algorithms for efficiency

### 3. Issue Reporting Contract

Enables community participation in park oversight:

- User-friendly problem reporting interface
- Photo and location verification for reported issues
- Issue categorization and priority assessment
- Status tracking from submission to resolution
- Reporter feedback and satisfaction metrics
- Pattern identification for systematic problems
- Gamification elements for community engagement

### 4. Resource Allocation Contract

Optimizes distribution of maintenance staff and resources:

- Staff skill inventory and availability tracking
- Equipment and supply inventory management
- Dynamic task assignment based on priority and proximity
- Resource utilization analytics and optimization
- Budget tracking and cost analysis
- Equitable distribution of resources across park system
- Performance metrics and efficiency reporting
